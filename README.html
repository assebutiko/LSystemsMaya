<h1 id="lsystemsmaya">LSystemsMaya</h1>
<p>Basic L-System rewriting with geometric interpretation in Maya.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>First of all, if you are not familiarized with git and you don't know how the cloning stuff works, just keep it simple:
Download all this project as a ZIP file (button on right side of the screen). Then, once you have extracted all the contents
on your Desktop or wherever you want..
<em> Uncompress the ZIP file you just downloaded
</em> Open <code>startScript.py</code> with Notepad or your favourite text editor
<em> Copy all the content from it.
</em> Paste it to the Script Editor in Maya
<em> Execute the code
</em> You will be asked to point the location where all the scripts are. You must point to the folder called <code>script</code> inside the
uncompressed  folder in which you have uncompressed the ZIP file.
* The UI should be created, then you can click on "Instructions" in order to get started as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This method for including the pointed folder as a sys.path for maya to access the files has been adapted from Jared Auty's
wonderful scripting project, which you can download here  http://bit.ly/1kDUXhj</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>I built up the UI considering standard users. <strong>There's a Help Line</strong>, there's an <strong>Instructions Button</strong>, and so on, I
recommend paying attention to them. What I could do is talk a little bit about L-Systems for those ones who don't know what
they are.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-l-systems">What are L-Systems?</h3>
<p>An L-system or is a parallel rewriting system and a type of formal grammar. An L-system consists of an alphabet of symbols
that can be used to make strings, a collection of production rules that expand each symbol into some larger string of
symbols, an initial "axiom" string from which to begin construction, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings
into geometric structures. <em>(from Wikipedia)</em></p>
<p><em>My turn now...</em> L-Systems consist on rewriting over a string of characters considering a bunch of rules. For instance you
can start with an initial word, for instance <code>F</code> (this is formally called <strong>Axiom</strong>), then you have some rewriting rules
that tell to replace this <code>F</code> by something a little bit more complex, for instance let's says replace <code>F</code> with <code>XF</code>.</p>
<p>If you apply this rule for each character of the word you would get <code>XF</code>, right? Because you iterated over the initial word.
So what if we want to iterate again over this string we got? We could! Because we still have the rule <code>F --&gt; XF</code>, so if we
run the rewriting system first of all we would come across an <code>X</code>, mmm.. we don't have any specific rule for it... Well,
nevermind, keep going. Next character is <code>F</code>, cool we have a rule for it, it says that we have to replace it with <code>XF</code>, go
on. <em>(We rewrite)</em> Now we get <code>XXF</code>.</p>
<p>We could carry on with this, we did 2 iterations over the string in this example, so the <strong>Depth</strong> would be two (now you
know what the depth parameter in my script is). You could expand the rules, you could have some rules for <code>X</code> as well. We
could even have another rule that said <code>F --&gt; GG</code> that could live with the previous one <code>F --&gt; XF</code>. <em>Wait, wait! If you have
rules that react to the same character (formally called <strong>predecessor</strong>), how can you chose which one to apply?</em> It's
simple, with <strong>percentages</strong>, with probability. And L-System which implements probability is called a Stochastic L-System.
That's cool, isn't it?</p>
<h3 id="how-do-they-relate-to-plants-turtle">How do they relate to plants? (Turtle)</h3>
<p>So far you could be asking yourself, how does that match to plants? Well... Here the <strong>Turtle Concept</strong> plays such an
important role. For those ones who don't know what the turtle paradigm is: imagine you were in the beach and you had a turtle
which you could control (I don't know how, maybe mental power!).</p>
<p>For instance you could tell the turtle (let's call it Leonardo, he is a male turtle) to move forward. If Leonardo did that,
he would leave a path with his tail in the sand, wouldn't he? You would be able to see his trail. Now you could keep yelling
commands to him such as <em>turn right Leo!</em>, <em>turn left!</em>. This is great but our amazing Leonardo can even do more crazy
stuff. Imagine you could tell him: <strong>Leo, remember your current position, save it in your little turtle mind</strong>, then, keep
walking forward and turning and more stuff until... when at some point we tell him <strong>go back to that position you saved
without leaving trail, teleport yourself!</strong>, then, keep doing other movements from the place I told you before to save in
your mind. This concept is called <strong>Pushing a state into the stack</strong> (remembering, saving), and <strong>Popping the state of the
turtle</strong> (going back to where we saved the state) // With this concept implemented we could leave trails in the sand that
would look like a branching system.</p>
<p>So with that silly explanation I wanted to say that we could give a <strong>meaning</strong> to each character in an L-System generated
string. For instance we could say <code>**F** is Move Forward</code>, <code>+ is Turn Left</code>, <code>- is Turn Right</code>... We are just building up a
language for the turtle commands, we are giving meaning to a bunch of characters, we are giving them a <strong>Geometrical
Interpretation</strong>. THIS IS THE ESSENCE, because L-Systems on their own they are nothing but text characters.</p>
<p>There are some conventions I will be using in this script. The turtle we talked about before it's two-dimensional, try to
translate the concept to the third dimension. I don't know, imagine Leo equipped with some sort of jet-pack, being the trail
he leaves the smoke emitted by the exhaust pipe... Oh... I am being too creative, pardon me. So bearing in mind that, I
collected this grammar:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>F</code>    Move forward</li>
<li><code>f</code>    Move forward</li>
<li><code>L</code>    Leaf</li>
<li><code>B</code>    Blossom</li>
<li><code>+</code>    Rotate +X (yaw right)</li>
<li><code>-</code>    Rotate -X (yaw left)</li>
<li><code>^</code>    Rotate +Y (roll right)</li>
<li><code>&amp;</code>    Rotate -Y (roll left)</li>
<li><code>&lt;</code>    Rotate +Z (pitch down)</li>
<li><code>&gt;</code>    Rotate -Z (pitch up)</li>
<li><code>*</code>    Turtle rotates 180 (as it was facing backwards)</li>
<li><code>[</code>   Push current turtle state on the stack</li>
<li><code>]</code>    Pop the current turtle state from the stack</li>
</ul>
<p>This way we can do complex things for instance having this grammar set:
<em> Axiom: <code>F</code>
</em> Production Rules: <code>F --&gt; F[-F]F[+F]F</code>
* Depth: 3</p>
<p>Then we could say that each step or "F" is a segment of <em>Length</em> 2, <em>Radius</em> 0.5, and each rotation is done considering a
Step <em>Angle</em> of 28... We can say as well, each time the turtle <em>pushes</em> his state, to slightly <em>decrease</em> the length or the
radius. This is what I implemented in my script.</p>
<p>Furthermore I added some fancy features such as customizing the <em>colour for the branches, for the leaves, and blossoms</em>. And
this is pretty much all. You can find all the procedures and modules documented in an <strong>HTML file</strong> inside the documentation
folder. Follow the help tips, and instructions of my script, you might need to practise in order to understand better!</p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docwhite/LSystemsMaya/master/examples/example.png" />
This is a quick generation using 3 different presets. It's more a general overview. Now I will comment some nice results I got. Major part of them are included in the preset buttons in the UI, try to mess around with them.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docwhite/LSystemsMaya/master/examples/example_preset1.png" />
The first preset uses this L-System:
<em> Axiom: <code>F</code>
</em> Rules: <code>F --&gt; F[&amp;+F]F[-&gt;FL][&amp;FB]</code>
<em> Depth: 5
</em> Angle: 28&#176;</p>
<img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docwhite/LSystemsMaya/master/examples/example_preset2.png" />
<p>This is a Stochastic L-System example, it's the second preset. I created it by myself, it looks good, I must have been so lucky. As they are Stochastic you can generate a few plants and stick with the one you like most. Use the Outliner and pick the plant group to move the entire geometry, it's more comfortable. The L-System:
<em> Axiom: <code>F</code>
</em> Rules: <strong>70%</strong> <code>F --&gt; F[+FL][-FB][&amp;FL][^FB]F</code>, <strong>30%</strong> <code>F -- &gt; [-FL]F[F[-FB-&amp;&amp;&gt;F][&amp;&gt;F]]</code>
<em> Depth: <strong>3</strong>
</em> Angle: <strong>25.7&#176;</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docwhite/LSystemsMaya/master/examples/example_preset3.png" />
<p>Again another Stochastic L-System preset. In perspective view looks a little bit 2D, but still nice. Tim Burton might love these kind of vegetation.
<em> Axiom: <code>S</code>
</em> Rules: 33% <code>S --&gt; S[&gt;&gt;&amp;&amp;FL][&gt;&gt;^^FL]S</code>, 33% <code>S -- &gt; S[-FL]F[S[-F-FB-&amp;&amp;&gt;S][&amp;&gt;F][+S]]</code>, 34% <code>S --&gt; S[+S[-FB][&amp;&gt;S]]</code>
<em> Depth: <strong>6</strong>
</em> Angle: <strong>26.5&#176;</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docwhite/LSystemsMaya/master/examples/example_sierpinski.png" />
<p>Fractal geometry is so beautiful. With this script you can also create them. They can be generated in many ways, and the L-System approach is one of them, our script is valid for it as well. For the Sierpinsky just enter:
<em> Axiom: <code>F</code>
</em> Rules: <code>F --&gt; X-F-X</code> and <code>X --&gt; F+X+F</code> (We need no percentages because they don't apply to the same predecessor)
<em> Depth: <strong>6</strong>
</em> Angle: <strong>60&#176;</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docwhite/LSystemsMaya/master/examples/example_gosper.png" />
<p>The Gosper curve is quite famous as well. It's L-System is:
<em> Axiom: <code>F</code>
</em> Rules: <code>F --&gt; F+R++R-F--FF-R+</code> and <code>R --&gt; -F+RR++R+F--F-R</code>
<em> Depth: <strong>5</strong>
</em> Angle: <strong>60&#176;</strong></p>
<p>It's normal if you didn't understand exactly what I explained in this readme file, I would recommend you to find a proper
explanation of the L-System concept, because it is so interesting! You can even apply L-Systems to music!</p>

LSystemsMaya
============

Basic L-System rewriting with geometric interpretation in Maya.

##Installation
First of all, if you are not on git and you don't know how the cloning stuff works, just download all this project as a ZIP file (button on right side of the screen). Then, once you have extracted all the contents on your Desktop or wherever you wanted...
* Copy all the content from `startScript.py`.
* Paste it to the Script Editor in Maya
* Execute the code
You will be asked to point the location where all the scripts are. You should search for the `script` folder inside the folder in which you have uncompressed the ZIP file.
*This method for including the pointed folder as a Pythonpath for maya to access the files has been adapted from Jared Auty's wonderful scripting project, which you can download here https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B75Ij6W0fkuidkxhY1ozanFzVEU*
